# Your rule content

- Could you add logs/comments to all the files
- complete the @CONTEXT.md to describe the current state of the application? This way, for future 
changes, we can understand what each part of the code does and how it relates to other files. 
- Always create a configuration value pair inside @config.json for items that are used across multiple files
